    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">The customer must be aware that there are many security threats, but the most common are: Cross-Site scripting, SQL injection and Cross-Site request forgery. <br>
      The best advice is to include everyone in security practices, some companies still believe that security should be managed by a specialized department, but such an approach is no longer viable. </p>
