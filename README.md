## Project Overview

Welcome to **Rainydays**, an online clothing store designed to offer a seamless and dynamic shopping experience. This website has undergone significant improvements over time, focusing on enhanced functionality and user experience.

As part of my Front-End development studies, I built this dynamic e-commerce web application using **WordPress** as a headless CMS, integrated with **WooCommerce** to manage the product catalog. By decoupling the front-end from WordPress, I created a custom REST API to facilitate real-time data exchange between the front-end and back-end.

## Built With:

- WordPress (Headless CMS)
- WooCommerce
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## Features:

- **WordPress REST API Integration**: The project leverages the WordPress REST API, specifically WooCommerce's API, to fetch product details dynamically, ensuring real-time updates and smooth data exchange.
- **Individual Product Pages**: Each product listed on the store has a dedicated detailed page, showcasing its description, price, and images, with an intuitive layout for users.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Headless CMS Architecture**: Decoupling the front-end from WordPress allows more flexibility and faster load times, improving the overall user experience.
